                    <h4>TableturfQ</h4>
                    <p>TableturfQ is an unofficial matchmaking service for the Tableturf Battle card game within Splatoon 3. Unlike every other multiplayer mode in Splatoon 3, Nintendo doesn’t offer any ingame matchmaking for Tableturf Battle. This has made it difficult for players to find others to battle against. The TableturfQ team’s goal is to offer Tableturf players a way to solve this problem by bringing together the Tableturf Battle community into one place where they can easily find others to play against.</p>
                    <p>TableturfQ does not include a simulation of Tableturf Battle, and you are expected to play the actual official game with your opponent after getting matched together, using the pool code: TTBQ.</p>

                        <h4>Casual Matchmaking</h4>
                        <p>For casual matchmaking, the goal is not to enforce any ruleset or restrict the players to how long they can play with each other. The only purpose for casual matchmaking is to let you find other players to battle against in a low-stress environment. Therefore, you do not record any game or match wins, and you may play however many matches you want with your opponent.</p>
                        <p>There is no restriction on the decks, timer, or stages being played in casual matches. You may end the session at any time by simply clicking the "Leave match" button.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h4>Ranked Matchmaking</h4>
                        <p>In ranked matches, you will play a best of <span id="ranked-best-of"></span> set against your opponent, using the standard competitive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_PbIJ8xr1bs5zWlEIaNGfVIHYaz5mRc09xxrdiQo2c/edit#heading=h.urjviui7vp6l" target="_blank">TBO ruleset</a>. You must record every game win / loss, as the match will only progress to the next game once both players have confirmed a game’s result. Once a match has finished, the players ratings will change. If you leave a ranked match, it counts as a forfeit.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Ratings and Ranks</h4>
                        <p>TableturfQ uses the Glicko-2 rating system for matchmaking and the leaderboard. You need to play 5 ranked matches before you can see your rating and appear on the leaderboard. The rank you have is determined by your current rating.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h4>Disputes</h4>
                        <p>If your opponent is being absent or uncooperative, you can call for a moderator to resolve the situation by pressing the dispute button. Please try to communicate with your opponent about the issue before putting a match into a dispute.</p>

                        <p>Disputes can be resolved by the players themselves, if both players click on the “Resolve dispute” button. In that case, the match will continue with no changes.</p>

                        <p>Matches are automatically put into a dispute when both players confirm contradicting results for a game. If this happens due to a misclick, it can easily be reverted by both players resolving the dispute by themselves.</p>

                        <p>Disputes are mainly meant to deal with absent players, players that take too long joining lobbies / choosing stages, or when players don’t record the game wins properly. If you want to report misconduct in the chat, it is better to send a support ticket in the TBS Discord server.</p>

                        <p>Moderators can view any match’s chat at any time. Other regular users that aren’t part of the match can not view the chat. This is the case even for when matches have ended.</p>

                        <p>Players have the responsibility to show respect to their opponents in the chat. All rules regarding the use of chats can be read <a class="site-rules-link">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Your rating is not affected by the result of a private battle, and disputes are not available in Private Battles. Otherwise, private battles function just like ranked battles.</p>

Then, you can restart the match with the correct settings. If you play out the first turn, you are not allowed to replay that game.</p>

                        <p>You are only allowed one replay per set from choosing the wrong deck. If you choose the wrong deck more than once, you have to play with that deck.</p>

                        <p>If your opponent takes more than 15 minutes to strike / choose stages, you receive 1 game win.</p>
